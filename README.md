Youtube to MP3/MP4 converter using pytube and moviepy.
A simple beginner friendly project.
It can download MP3, MP4 and in one run MP3 and MP4 simultaneously

HOW TO USE IT:
Download the python file and run it
You need to have python 3 installed on your machine in order to run it



NOTES:  
Since pytube, from what I know, doesn't download MP3 files, I used the library moviepy to convert the MP4 file to MP3.
I am planning on creating a version of this with a GUI
